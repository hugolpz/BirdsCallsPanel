### Single app code
We cheerfully thanks the following projects: 

 - [HandlebarsJS](http://handlebarsjs.com) -- used to swiftly construct the page from json data,
 - [HowlerJS](https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js) -- used to smoothly play audio files with fall back on html5 audio. HowlerJS allows synchroneous multiplays which gives kids a tropical jungle's feeling !
